# WPF-ConverterDemo
Demo of MVVM databinding and using a ValueConverter 

This project demonstrates:

* MVVM pattern
* Databinding properties from a Window to a ViewModel 
* Using a IValueConverter to handle converting user input into the correct data type
 
In the demo, a value is input by the user into a textbox. It is converted by the converter, passed to the ViewModel then converted back to a string and passed back to a second textbox and displayed.
